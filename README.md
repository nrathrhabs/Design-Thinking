## Overview
This semester, I engaged in a comprehensive project centered around the development of the GROCER4U app, designed to assist elderly individuals with grocery shopping and kitchen management. Through the application of design thinking principles, I learned to empathize with users, define their needs, ideate solutions, and prototype a user-friendly app. The project highlighted the significance of technology in enhancing accessibility and convenience, particularly for disadvantaged groups. I gained practical experience in conducting user interviews, analyzing feedback, and implementing features that cater specifically to the elderly, such as expiration tracking and recipe suggestions based on dietary preferences.




## Step by Step Process: Dissassembling the CPU
     
### 1. Removing the CPU power

The first step was to carefully remove the outer CPU plate. This required unscrewing the casing and ensuring the panel was detached without damaging its fittings. Proper handling of the cover ensures no stress on the internal components.

### 2. Detaching the Power Power Supply and Wires

Next, the orange and blue wires were disconnected, followed by removing the power supply unit. Care was taken to label the connections to avoid any confusion during reassembly.

### 3. Extracting the RAM

The RAM was carefully removed by pushing down the retention clips on either side of the slot and lifting the module. Handling the RAM by its edges is crucial to avoid static damage.

### 4. Removing the Hard Disk
The hard disk drive was unscrewed from its mounting bracket and disconnected from the SATA cables. Proper care was taken to ensure no force was applied to the delicate connectors.

## Reflection
Reflecting on this semester, I recognize the substantial growth I experienced in both technical and soft skills. The collaborative nature of the GROCER4U project fostered effective communication and teamwork, allowing me to appreciate diverse perspectives and ideas. I also learned the importance of user-centered design, which will be invaluable in my future endeavors. However, I believe there is room for improvement in the areas of project management and feedback mechanisms. Establishing clearer timelines and more structured feedback processes could enhance the overall efficiency of group projects. Overall, this experience has solidified my interest in combining technology with social impact, motivating me to continue exploring innovative solutions for real-world challenges.
