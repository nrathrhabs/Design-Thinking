## Overview
This semester, I engaged in a comprehensive project centered around the development of the GROCER4U app, designed to assist elderly individuals with grocery shopping and kitchen management. Through the application of design thinking principles, I learned to empathize with users, define their needs, ideate solutions, and prototype a user-friendly app. The project highlighted the significance of technology in enhancing accessibility and convenience, particularly for disadvantaged groups. I gained practical experience in conducting user interviews, analyzing feedback, and implementing features that cater specifically to the elderly, such as expiration tracking and recipe suggestions based on dietary preferences.



## GROCER4U Video 
The video provides a dynamic overview of the GROCER4U app, demonstrating its features and user experience. It can include a walkthrough of the app's functionalities, testimonials from potential users, and highlights of the design process. This visual medium is effective for conveying the app's purpose and benefits, making it accessible to a broader audience. Explain the video's objectives, the key messages it aims to communicate, and how it complements the other components by providing a visual and auditory representation of the project.

## GROCER4U Prototype
The prototype serves as a tangible representation of the GROCER4U app's design and functionality. It showcases the user interface, navigation flow, and key features such as account setup, grocery search, recipe suggestions, and expiration tracking. This component is crucial for visualizing how the app will operate in real life and allows for user testing and feedback before the final development. Discuss the tools used for prototyping, the design choices made to cater to elderly users, and any iterations that occurred based on user feedback.

## Reflection
Reflecting on this semester, I recognize the substantial growth I experienced in both technical and soft skills. The collaborative nature of the GROCER4U project fostered effective communication and teamwork, allowing me to appreciate diverse perspectives and ideas. I also learned the importance of user-centered design, which will be invaluable in my future endeavors. However, I believe there is room for improvement in the areas of project management and feedback mechanisms. Establishing clearer timelines and more structured feedback processes could enhance the overall efficiency of group projects. Overall, this experience has solidified my interest in combining technology with social impact, motivating me to continue exploring innovative solutions for real-world challenges.
